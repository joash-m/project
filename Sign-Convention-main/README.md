Sign Convention Data Capture and Model Training
This project captures data based on sign conventions (e.g., forces, displacements) and trains a machine learning model to predict or classify data according to these conventions.

Overview
Capture data on physical quantities like forces, displacements, and velocities, then train a model to predict or classify based on sign conventions (positive and negative directions).

Data Capture
Input Data
Force: Vector components (x, y, z).
Displacement: Movement along x, y, and z.
Velocity: Direction of motion.
Energy/Work: Positive or negative based on direction.
Data Format
Data captured in CSV/JSON with columns:

force_x, force_y, displacement_x, displacement_y, etc.
Model Training
The captured data is used to train a machine learning model (e.g., regression, classification) to predict sign convention-based outcomes.

Model Usage
After training, use the model to predict new data or classify based on the sign conventions learned during training.
